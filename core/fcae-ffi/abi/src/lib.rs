//! # fcae-abi — the C ABI contract
//!
//! Every `#[repr(C)]` type that crosses the FFI boundary is declared here and
//! **only** here. This crate has no dependencies and does no I/O, so it can be
//! compiled by cbindgen, by bindings generators, and by tests without dragging
//! in tokio or a tunnel engine.
//!
//! ## Versioning rules
//!
//! * `FCAE_ABI_VERSION` is bumped on **any** layout change.
//! * Structs passed *in* by the host start with `struct_size: u32` so the
//!   library can accept an older/newer caller instead of reading garbage. This
//!   is what the old `AetherConfig` lacked: adding a field silently broke every
//!   prebuilt UI binary.
//! * Fields are only ever appended, never reordered or removed. Removed fields
//!   become `_reserved`.
